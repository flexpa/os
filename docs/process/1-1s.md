# 🤝 1:1s

At Flexpa, we are opinionated about how 1:1s should work. We know that 1:1s are a popular management tool but just because they are popular doesn’t mean every company does them the same way. The goal of codifying our version of 1:1s is to make them consistent. Consistency is important because it creates clarity.

Not every meeting between two people is a "1:1". A 1:1 is a specific kind of recurring meeting, with a stable format, where every Flexpal can expect the dedicated, full attention of their manager. The purpose of a 1:1 is to create and maintain a working relationship between a Flexpal and their manager, or their manager’s manager, to exchange information, and mutually learn from one another. 

At Flexpa, 1:1s are typified by the discussion of problems. At their best, they help us to identify problems and improve. The most important subjects to talk about in a 1:1 are the ones we often avoid. Issues that preoccupy and nag our attention – the thorns. These are the kind of subjects that often take time to surface, consider, and resolve and require us all to build strong relationships.

Examples of meetings that _aren’t_ 1:1s:

* Two designers having coffee catchup every Friday morning and review completed / outstanding work **is not** a 1:1 because they are direct role peers
* Pair programming **is not** a 1:1 because the agenda changes even if it recurs on a schedule and the goal is purely solutionizing around code as opposed to discussing larger thorns
* A BDR calling an Account Executive to review the copy for an email **is not** a 1:1 because it is mission specific / not a stable format

Every 1:1 at Flexpa must follow these procedural rules:

* Must have a clearly defined format listed on this page – no phantom or unstructured 1:1s
* Must be scheduled with a recurring calendar invite for the same time
* Must have a calendar invite that includes one of the descriptions listed on this page
* Must have a running 1:1 doc attached to the calendar invite
* Must have an agenda written in the 1:1 in advance - which must be prepared by Flexpal reporting to their manager
* Finally, 1:1s must be skipped when the agenda is not ready in advance

There are two types of 1:1s at Flexpa, with different cycles.

1. A **weekly** or **bi-weekly** direct manager 1:1
2. A **monthly** "skip level" 1:1

## Direct manager 1:1

This is the most frequent 1:1 at Flexpa. This 1:1 format occurs between a direct manager and a direct report.

The frequency (weekly or bi-weekly) is determined by the level of knowledge, skills, and experience a Flexpal possesses for their current role / task (aka Task Relevant Maturity). A very experienced individual contributor who is managing for the first time may benefit from just as much guidance as a junior designer new to the job.

The format is as follows:

> Every week, we will meet to discuss at least three of the following 5 topics — but you must set the outline of the agenda each time in advance. We will discuss every topic at least once a month, and I will ask about this area when I notice it hasn't been on our agenda. If you think a topic doesn't clearly fit, that's perfectly fine, provide your own label:

> * Indicators, project status, process
> * Missions, alignment, decision making
> * Feedback (push and pull), guidance
> * Team dynamics, people problems
> * Career development, growth, admin

## Skip Level 1:1

This 1:1 format “skips” a level. These occur once a month. The focus is moving up one layer and focusing in on the company level rather than at the individual level which is the focus of the Direct Manager 1:1s. 

The format is as follows:

> Every month, we will meet to discuss at least three of the following 5 topics — but you must set the outline of the agenda each time in advance. We will discuss every topic at least once a month, and I will ask about this area when I notice it hasn't been on our agenda. If you think a topic doesn't clearly fit, that's perfectly fine, provide your own label:

> * Flexpa company vision
> * Possible process, strategy and tactics improvements
> * Career coaching
> * Flexpa culture
> * Feedback on management

Our goal in codifying our version of 1:1s is to ensure consistency and create clarity within our organization. While 1:1 meetings are a popular management tool, we recognize that not every company conducts them the same way. By adhering to these guidelines, we aim to foster strong relationships, promote growth, and enable our mission to refactor healthcare. 

My changes.
