# 🏞️ Retreats

Quarterly in-person retreats are crucial for Flexpa. Every three months, the entire team meets together in person for a three-day retreat that serves as a cornerstone of our company culture. During these retreats, we engage in various activities, including team-building exercises, strategic discussions on our go-to-market and product strategies, and retroing past OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) while finalizing the OKRs for the upcoming quarter. These retreats are instrumental in fostering collaboration, aligning our goals, and propelling our mission forward.


First and foremost, the retreats provide us with team-building opportunities that we otherwise miss out on as a remote team. Being able to connect with each other on a personal level in the same room is invaluable in building stronger ties. We strengthen our relationships, enhance collaboration skills, provide critical process feedback, and build camaraderie. These activities create a cohesive and motivated workforce, which is vital for achieving our mission of refactoring healthcare.

Additionally, the retreats offer us a dedicated space for strategic discussions. With our entire team present, we can tap into the wealth of diverse perspectives from different departments. During Flexpa retreats, we engage in brainstorming sessions, workshops, and in-depth conversations to refine our go-to-market and product strategies. By collectively reviewing our past performance, analyzing market trends, and leveraging our collective intelligence, we can make informed decisions and adapt our approaches. This collaborative approach ensures that our strategies are robust and aligned with our mission.

Lastly, the retreats are a great way to finalize our OKRs for the next quarter. Through comprehensive discussions and input from the entire team, we define ambitious objectives and key results that propel us forward. These goals guide our efforts, helping us measure progress and stay focused on our mission to refactor healthcare. We also vote as a team on the location of the next retreat.

As a remote-first organization, our quarterly in-person retreats are the heartbeat of our operational and cultural framework. Through these retreats, we cultivate a strong sense of camaraderie, nurture collaboration, provide the space for strategic discussions, and align on ambitious objectives to drive our mission of refactoring healthcare. The retreats play an integral role in propelling our company forward, ensuring that we remain focused, motivated, and united in transforming the healthcare landscape forever.

**Agenda considerations**

* Overall itinerary
    * Retreat activities fit into Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday days
        * Monday is mostly a travel day, but organizing a team dinner for those who arrive before dinner is important for Day 1 camaraderie
        * Friday is a travel/personal day for everyone
    * Game time itinerary management will always be the case. People need breaks, things go longer, shorter, etc

* What activities should be included?
    * What are the highest leverage things for us to do in person?
    * What are the biggest priorities for next quarter?
    * What was the feedback from the last quarter? 
    * What will set us up for the next quarter or further the best?
    * What products/problems/opportunities can we brainstorm to get the juices flowing early?

* Activities that need to be present in some form:
    * Tuesday
        * Kickoff as retreat opening (Owner: Co-founders)
        * Start/Stop/Continue style retro [soon after kickoff]
        * (Optional) JD updates if new Flexpals have joined, or roles have changed,  (Team/ Andrew Arruda)
