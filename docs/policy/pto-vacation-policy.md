# ðŸŒ´ PTO / Vacation Policy

## Requesting Time Off

1. Communicate the request to your manager as soon as possible. If you are unsure whether or not you would like to take the time off, you can always remove it from the holiday calendar if you decide not to.&#x20;
2. Once your manager grants approval, add your planned time off to the Flexpa calendar and invite you & your manager for visibility.&#x20;
3. Mark the dates as "Out of Office" dates in your calendar and enable the Google Calendar setting **"decline all new meetings"** to prevent any calendar chaos in the weeks leading up to your time off.&#x20;
4. Communicate all pending and outstanding tasks to your manager in the days leading up to your time off and add an additional note to your standup to remind the team. We would rather have you over-communicate than under-communicate. Preparation will be key to ensuring that your manager and colleagues are well-prepared for well-deserved time off!&#x20;
